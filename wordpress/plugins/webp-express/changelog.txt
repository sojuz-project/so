= 0.17.2 =
*(released: 5 Oct 2019)*

* Fixed bug: Updating plugin failed on a few hosts (in the unzip phase). Problem was introduced in 0.17.0 with the updated binaries.
* Fixed bug: Alter HTML used the protocol (http/https) for the site for generated links (rather than keeping the protocol for the link). Thanks to Jacob Gullberg from Sweden for discovering this bug.

If you experienced update problems due to the update bug, you will probably be left with an incomplete installation. Some of the plugin files are there, but not all. Especially, the main plugin file (webp-express.php) is missing, which means that Wordpress don't "see" the plugin (it is missing from the list). Trying to install WebP Express again will probably not work, because the "webp-express" folder is already there. You will then have to remove the "webp-express" folder in "plugins" manually (via ftp or a plugin, such as File Manager).

*(released: 27 sep 2019)*

* Cwebp conversion method runs on more systems (not subject to open_basedir restrictions and also tries "pure" cwebp command). Thanks to cng11 for reaching out so I spotted this.
* Ewww conversion method no longer does a remote api-key check for each conversion - so it is faster. If an ewww conversions fails due to a non-functional key, the key will not be tried again (until next time the options are saved)
* Updated cwebp binaries to version 1.0.3

= 0.16.0 =
*(released: 24 sep 2019)*

= 0.15.2 =

* Fixed the bug when File extension was set to "Set to .webp". It was buggy when file extension contained uppercase letters.

= 0.15.1 =
*(released: 17 sep 2019)*

* Bug alert: Added alert about a bug when destination folder is set to "mingled" and File extension is set to "Set to .webp"
* Bugfix: Plugin URL pointed to webpexpress - it should point to parent. This gave trouble with images located in plugins. Thanks to Guillaume Meyer from Switzerland for discovering and reporting.
* Bugfix: Images with uppercase chars in extension did not get Vary:Accept
* Bugfix: There were issues with "All content" and destination:document-root when webp-realizer is activated

= 0.15.0 =
*(released: 17 sep 2019)*

* Provided test-buttons for checking if the redirects works.
* You can now choose which folders WebP Express is active in. Ie "Uploads and Themes".
* You can now choose an alternative file structure for the webps which does not rely on DOCUMENT_ROOT being available.
* WebP Express can now handle when wp-content is symlinked.
* The .htaccess rules are now divided across folders. Some rules are needed where the source files are located, some where the webp files are located.
* Added option to convert only PNG files
* And a couple of bugfixes.

= 0.14.22 =
*(released: 4 aug 2019)*

* Fixed bug in Nginx rules in the FAQ (they did not take into account that the webp images outside upload folder are never stored "mingled")
* Fixed bug: The extension setting was not respected - it was always appending ".webp", never setting. Thanks to Florian from Germany and Derrick Hammer from USA for reporting.
* Fixed bug: It turns out that Imagick gives up quality detection for some images and returns 0. This resulted in very poor quality webps when the quality was set to same as jpeg. The 0 is now treated as a failure and the max-quality will be used for such images. Thanks to @sanjayojha303 from India for reporting that there were quality problems on some images.
* Fixed bug-like behavior: The conversion scripts no longer requires that the respective setting is on for Nginx. Thanks to Mike from Russia for reporting this.
* Fixed bug: The error handler in webp-convert for handling warnings could in some cases result in endless recursion. For some the result was that they could no longer upload images. Thanks to Tobias Keller from Germany for reporting this bug.
* Fixed minor bug: Attempt to call private method in a rare scenario (when accessing one of the php scripts in the "wod" folder directly - which is not allowed). Thanks to Giacomo Lawrance from the U.K. for providing input that led to this discovery.
* Fixed minor bug: It was not tested whether a corresponding webp existed before trying to deleting it when an image was deleted. This produced warnings in debug.log.
* Security related: Added sanitizing of paths to avoid false positives on coderisk.com (there where no risk because already test the paths for sanity - but this is not detected by coderisk, as the variable is not modified). This was simply done in order get rid of the warnings at coderisk.
* Security fix: Paths were not sanitized on Windows.

– Security fix: Added capability checks to options page.
– Security fix: Sanitized user input.
– Security fix: Added checks for file paths and directories.
– Security fix: Nonces and capability checks for AJAX calls.

* Security fix: Closed a security hole that could be used to view the content of any file on the server (provided that the full path is known or guessed). This is a very serious flaw, which has been around for quite a while. I urge you to upgrade to 0.14.0.
* Added new "encoding" option, which can be set to auto. This can in some cases dramatically reduce the size of the webp. It is supported by all converters except ewww and gd.
* Added new "near-lossless" option (only for cwebp and vips). Using this is a good idea for reducing size of lossless webps with an acceptable loss of quality
* Added new "alpha-quality" option (all converters, except ewww and gd). Using this is a good idea when images with transparency are converted to lossy webp - it has the potential to reduce the size up to 50% (depending on the source material) while keeping an acceptable level of quality
* Added new conversion methods: Vips and GraphicsMagick
* Imagick conversion method now supports webp options (finally cracked it!)
* Using MimeType detection instead of relying on file extensions
* In "test" converter you now change options and also test PNG files
* Added conversion logs
* PNGs are now enabled by default (with the new conversion features especially PNGs are compressed much better)

* Fixed bug: Alter HTML crashed when HTML was larger than 600kb and "image urls" where selected

= 0.12.0 =
*(released 5 mar 2019)*
* Multisite support (!)
* A new operation mode: "No conversion", if you do not want to use WebP Express for converting. Replaces the old "Just redirect" mode
* Added capability testing of .htaccess. The .htaccess rules are now tailored to the capabilities on the system. For example, on some platforms the filename of a requested image is passed to the converter script through the query string, but on platforms that supports passing it through an environment variable, that method is used instead
* Picturefill.js is now optional (alter html, picture tag)
* A great bunch more!

= 0.11.3 =
*(released 18 feb 2019)*
* Fixed bug: Alter HTML caused media library not to display images on some systems. Alter HTML is now disabled in admin mode.
* Alter HTML (picture tags) could produce the source tags with "src" attribute. But source tags inside picture tags must use "srcset" attribute. Fixed.
* Alter HTML (image urls): srcsets containing "x" descriptors wasn't handled (ie, srcset="image.jpg 1x")
* Fixed rewrite rules when placed in root so they are confined to wp-content and uploads. In particular, they no longer apply in wp-admin area, which might have caused problems, ie with media library.
* Added warning when rules are placed in root and "Convert non-existing webp-files upon request" feature is enabled and WebP Express rules are to be placed below Wordpress rules
* Fixed bug: The code that determined if WebP Express had placed rules in a .htaccess failed in "CDN friendly" mode. The effect was that these rules was not cleaned up upon plugin deactivation

= 0.11.2 =

* Alter HTML to point to webp files (choose between picture tags or simply altering all image urls)
* Convert non-existing webp-files upon request (means you can reference the converted webp files before they are actually converted!)

* New conversion method, which calls imagick binary directly. This will make WebP express work out of the box on more systems
* Made sure not to trigger LFI warning i Wordfence (to activate, click the force .htaccess button)
* Imagick can now be configured to set quality to auto on systems where the auto option isn't generally available
* Added Last-Modified header to images. This makes image caching work better
* Added condition in .htaccess that checks that source file exists before handing over to converter
* On some systems, converted files where stored in ie *..doc-rootwp-content..* rather than *..doc-root/wp-content..*. This is fixed, a clean-up script corrects the file structure upon upgrade.

*(released 4 okt 2018)*
This version added option for setting caching header, fixed a serious issue with *Imagick*, added a new converter, *Gmagick*, added a great deal of options to *Cwebp* and generally improved the interface.

* Added option for caching
* Fixed long standing and serious issue with Imagick converter. It no longer generates webp images in poor quality
* Added gmagick as a new conversion method
* WebPExpress now runs on newly released WebP-Convert 1.2.0
* Added many new options for *cwebp*
* You can now quickly see converter status by hovering over a converter
* You can now choose between having quality auto-detected or not (if the server supports detecting quality).
* If the server does not support detecting quality, the WPC converter will display a quality "auto" option
* Added special intro message for those who has no working conversion methods
* Added help texts for options
* Settings are now saved, when changing converter options. Too many times, I found myself forgetting to save...

= 0.5.0 =
This version works on many more setups than the previous. Also uses less resources and handles when images are changed.

* Configuration is now stored in a separate configuration file instead of storing directly in the *.htaccess* file and passing it on via query string. When updating, these settings are migrated automatically.
* Handles setups where Wordpress has been given its own directory (both methods mentioned [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory))
* Handles setups where *wp-content* has been moved, even out of Wordpress root.
* Handles setups where Uploads folder has been moved, even out of *wp-content*.
* Handles setups where Plugins folder has been moved, even out of *wp-content* or out of Wordpress root
* Is not as likely to be subject to firewalls blocking requests (in 0.4.0, we passed all options in a querystring, and that could trigger firewalls under some circumstances)
* Is not as likely to be subject to rewrite rules from other plugins interfering. WebP Express now stores the .htaccess in the wp-content folder (if you allow it). As this is deeper than the root folder, the rules in here takes precedence over rules in the main *.htaccess*
* The *.htaccess* now passes the complete absulute path to the source file instead of a relative path. This is a less error-prone method.
* Reconverts the webp, if source image has changed
* Now runs on version 1.0.0 of [WebP On Demand](https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-on-demand). Previously ran on 0.3.0
* Now takes care of only loading the PHP classes when needed in order not to slow down your Wordpress. The frontend will only need to process four lines of code. The backend footprint is also quite small now (80 lines of code of hooks)
* Now works in Wordpress 4.0 - 4.6.
* Added cache-breaking tokens to image test links
* Denies deactivation if rewrite rules could not be removed
* Refactored thoroughly
* More helpful texts.
* Extensive testing. Tested on Wordpress 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9. Tested with PHP 5.6, PHP 7.0 and PHP 7.1. Tested on Apache and LiteSpeed. Tested when missing various write permissions. Tested migration. Tested when installed in root, in subfolder, when Wordpress has its own directory (both methods), when wp-content is moved out of Wordpress directory, when plugins is moved out of Wordpress directory, when both of them are moved and when uploads have been moved.

= 0.4.0 =
This version fixes some misbehaviours and provides new http headers with info about the conversion process.

* Fixed bug: .htaccess was not updated every time the settings was saved.
* Fixed bug: The plugin generated error upon activation.
* Now produces X-WebP-Convert-And-Serve headers with info about the conversion - useful for validating that converter receives the expected arguments and executes correctly.
* WebPExpress options are now removed when plugin is uninstalled.
* No longer generates .htaccess rules on install. The user now has to actively go to Web Express setting and save first
* Added a "first time" message on options page and a reactivation message
