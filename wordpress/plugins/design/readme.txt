ü§¶I'm sorry for the delay in releasing new designs during the last few weeks. While adding new sections into the library, I faced with import process performance degradation. It became clear that the current code will not handle thousands of designs and need rewriting. In this update I recoded from scratch all the design import processes. Now the plugin is ready to manage thousands of designs without any performance issues.

* ‚≠ê Completely recoded design import processes.
* ‚≠ê Now you can drag and drop designs on the page.
